# Chris Frantz

# Objective
To advance my career by taking on a Solutions Architect position that enables me to bring my leadership abilitiies and passion for development to help architect solutions across multiple teams and systems.

# Who am I?

I'm passionate about architecting web applications that make users excited and tasks easier on a global scale.

Natural leader that thrives on implementing clean, maintainable, standards oriented code and being a team player that is dedicated to a project’s and team’s success.

I have over 19 years of experience in developing large complex quoting, issuing, claims, and customer service applications in the insurance industry. I love helping teams learn new technologies, make apps run faster, more secure, cost less, easier to maintain, and helping them sleep better at night knowing that things will work.

Constantly looking to push myself and learn more. Currently I'm eagerly exploring Serverless architectues, GraphQL (Apollo and AppSync), and delivering cloud architectures on AWS in general.
